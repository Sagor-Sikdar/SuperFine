*** Run the following command to give paup the executable permission
  "chmod +x paup".  


*** Run this command : "python ./runSuperFine.py -r rmrp speciesTrees.tre -w tre"... 
Here, "speciesTrees.tre" is a sample input file where you can get 4 species trees generated from restricted gene trees. Running this command, you'll get two new files ( speciesTrees.scmTree.tre and speciesTrees.SuperFineTree.tre ). I suppose you would need the scmTree for your project.
